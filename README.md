# PlexPreroller ðŸŽ¬

**PlexPreroller** is a self-hosted tool and workflow manager for Plex prerolls (intros and bumpers shown before movies or TV).  
It lets you upload, organize, and rotate preroll videos â€” with optional **n8n automation** for seasonal themes, random rolls, or nightly rotation.

---

## Features

- Upload and manage preroll videos through a web UI  
- Rotate prerolls automatically with included **n8n workflows**  
- Organize prerolls by theme (holiday, trailers, custom bumpers)  
- Works with Plexâ€™s `cinemaTrailersPrerollID` preference  
- Docker-ready (single `docker-compose up`)  
- API secured with admin key

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plexpreroller.git
cd plexpreroller
```

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Example values:
```env

```

### 3. Run with Docker

## Usage

1. Open the web UI  
2. Enter your `ADMIN_API_KEY`  
3. Upload preroll videos (MP4, MKV)  
4. Apply changes â€” Plex will start showing your prerolls before playback ðŸŽ‰

## Automation with n8n

This repo includes example workflows in the `n8n/` folder:

- `rotate-prerolls-nightly.json` â†’ pick a new preroll each day  
- `seasonal-themes.json` â†’ swap in holiday-themed intros automatically  

Import them into your n8n instance, set the API endpoint + key, and enjoy hands-off preroll management.
